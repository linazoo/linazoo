# Hola, I'm Lina👋

**linazoo/linazoo** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->

A Colombian living and working in Texas. I’m a self taught front end developer FKA UX designer who has way too many hobbies and a husky named Grits. 

I just left my job as a user interface engineer in finance to focus full time on learning modern technologies and hopefully find a new gig as a front end React dev.
