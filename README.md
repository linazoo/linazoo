# Hola, I'm Lina ⚡

A Colombian born, east-coast designer turned developer, living and working in Tejas. 

I love community organizing, a home cooked meal with my family, bird watching, art & design, books, gym, plants, drawing, and hanging out with my husky Grits. I'm a Taurus 🌞, Aquarius 🌚, Scorpio ☝ and Myer-Briggs Pesonality type of INTJ-T if you care about that 🪐
